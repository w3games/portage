  <description>A fast dynamic tiling window manager</description>
</maintainer>
<longdescription>FrankenWM is a dynamic tiling WM (comparable to dwm or Awesome), featuring the v-stack, b-stack, grid, fibonacci, dualstack, equal and monocle layouts out of the box. If you want to, you can add gaps between the windows as well.

It was once based on monsterwm but has undergone many greater changes including adding pieces from other WMs (hence the name) and porting all sorts of stuff from Xlib to XCB. Many of the original monsterwm patches have been ported as well.

All settings must be set at compile time by editing config.h and it does not feature a status bar (but supports leaving preconfigured space for one).
