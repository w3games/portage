dev-lang/lua is not in the best shape in gentoo. It was originally unslotted, and is being transitioned
to slotted, but these versions are masked. It is a pain maintaining the masks -- easier to just fork it.

Lua is designed to be a language that gets embedded in other applications. It should likely be built
along with those other applications rather than linked against a shared library that can change. This
is probably the preferred approach for lua in the future rather than simply making it slotted.
